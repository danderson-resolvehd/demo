Instructions for Patient: John has been advised to monitor for signs of chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other cardiac symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if these occur. He should adhere strictly to his medication regimen, especially the dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent stent thrombosis. Lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation (if applicable) were emphasized to reduce cardiovascular risk.</p>",

    summary: "<p>John Doe was admitted for an acute myocardial infarction and underwent PCI with stent placement for significant CAD. He was discharged with a comprehensive cardiac care plan, including medication adjustments and follow-up care with both a cardiologist and endocrinologist to manage his heart disease and associated risk factors effectively.</p>",
    raw: "Name: John Doe, Date of Birth: 01/01/1965, Hospital ID: 987654321, Admission Date: 12/01/2017, Discharge Date: 12/06/2017, Attending Physician: Dr. Alexander Hamilton Hospital Course: John Doe was admitted with chest pain and shortness of breath. Initial assessments included an EKG showing abnormal rhythms and an elevated troponin level, indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). John's history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension added complexity to his cardiovascular risk profile. An urgent cardiac catheterization confirmed the presence of significant coronary artery disease (CAD), with one major artery showing 70% stenosis.	EKG: Demonstrated ST-segment elevation in anterior leads. Troponin: Elevated, peaking at 4 ng/mL. Echocardiogram: Revealed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 40%, indicating impaired cardiac function. Cardiac Catheterization: Identified significant stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Management: John underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the LAD artery. Post-procedure, his chest pain resolved, and cardiac function stabilized. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with Aspirin and Clopidogrel, along with high-intensity statin therapy for cholesterol management. His existing medications for diabetes and hypertension were reviewed and adjusted to optimize cardiovascular risk reduction.	Discharge Diagnoses: 1.Acute Myocardial Infarction 2.Coronary Artery Disease 3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, stable 4. Hypertension, ongoing management Medications at Discharge: Aspirin 81 mg daily, Clopidogrel 75 mg daily, Atorvastatin 80 mg nightly, Lisinopril 20 mg daily, Metformin 1000 mg twice daily, Amlodipine 10 mg daily, Insulin Glargine, dose adjusted as per glucose monitoring	John is scheduled for a follow-up with his cardiologist in two weeks to assess his recovery post-PCI and to adjust his cardiac medications as needed. An appointment with his endocrinologist is also scheduled to ensure optimal management of his diabetes in the context of his recent cardiac event. Further, he will participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program to aid in his recovery and improve his cardiovascular health. Instructions for Patient: John has been advised to monitor for signs of chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other cardiac symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if these occur. He should adhere strictly to his medication regimen, especially the dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent stent thrombosis. Lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation (if applicable) were emphasized to reduce cardiovascular risk.	Follow up with Emily Thompson scheduled for 10/11/2024	John Doe was admitted for an acute myocardial infarction and underwent PCI with stent placement for significant CAD. He was discharged with a comprehensive cardiac care plan, including medication adjustments and follow-up care with both a cardiologist and endocrinologist to manage his heart disease and associated risk factors effectively."
